Random ToolBox
==============

This is just another Random Toolbox: somewhere to dump miscellaneous 
utility scripts, ephemera and other paraphernalia relating to my
general hacking activities. A bit like that rusty old box at the
back of the garden shed.

Don't expect structure, wisdom or, well, pretty-much anything really
but anything you might find you are free to use and, hopefully, find
useful (subject, of couse, to the appropriate LICENSE).
