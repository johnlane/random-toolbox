# Backup to remote rsync service
#
# Usage: backup backup-host local-path [ local-path ... ]
#
# Each local-path will be backed up to backup-host, which
# must provide an rsync service named the same as the name
# of the user running this script. For example, if user 
# 'joe' runs the command 'backup zeus Documents Photos', a
# backup will be performed to the remote rsync service at
# 'zeus::joe'.
#
# If an identical backup is already running then nothing is
# done (this avoids running multiple jobs).
#
# The normal use of this script would be via a cron job. An
# example crontab is shown below:
#
#    MAILTO=joe@example.com
#    */30 * * * * /home/joe/backup zeus Documents Photos
#
# tested against Vixie Cron
