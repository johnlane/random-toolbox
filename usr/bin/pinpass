# This is a simple password generator that allows a pin code   #
# to be used to represent a password which may provide more    #
# security in circumstances where passwords are written down.  #
#
# It uses a "phrase-book" - a data file that defines a set of  #
# up to ten phrases that are used to generate passwords from a #
# five-digit pin code. The first line of the phrase file must  #
# contain a configuration string as described below. The       #
# following ten lines (maximum) should each contain a ten-word #
# phrase.                                                      #
#                                                              #
# The configuration string is a sequence of characters. The    #
# first is a digit, between 1 and 5, that determines which     #
# digit of the five-digit pin is used to select one of the ten #
# phrases to use. The other digits of the pin code are used to #
# select four words from the phrase to form a password. The    #
# remaining characters of the configuration string are read,   #
# one at a time, and interpreted as commands. A command may    #
# consume other characters from the configuration string and   #
# use them to transform the password. Supported commands are   #
# described below.                                             #
#                                                              #
#    word suffix: a digit between 0 and 4 will cause that      #
#    word in the pasword to have the next character from the   #
#    configuration string to be appended to it.                #
#                                                              #
#    character transform: an alpha character will cause any    #
#    occurance of that character (either upper- or lower-case) #
#    in the password to be replaced by the next character from #
#    the configuration string.                                 #
#                                                              #
# The phrase-book is a user-specific confidential data         #
# file that should be secured to keep its contents secret.     #
#                                                              #
# Running pinpass without aruments will display a brief usage  #
# summary. Assuming a suitably prepared phrase-book called     #
# ".pinpass" in the user's home directory, pinpass should be   #
# invoked with a pin code like this:                           #
#                                                              #
#    $ pinpass 12345                                           #
#                                                              #
# and pinpass will display the related password along with,    #
# as an aide-memoire, the four words used to generate it.      #
#                                                              #
# Alternatively, if a URL is given then pinpass will generate  #
# a pin code using a very simple hashing algorithm. This can   #
# be used as an alternative to remembering pin codes:          #
#                                                              #
#    $ pinpass www.example.com                                 #
#                                                              #
# If a question-mark "?" is given, pinpass will generate a     #
# random pin code and then display the corresponding password. #
#                                                              #
#    $ pinpass ?                                               #
#                                                              #
